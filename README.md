This repo shows how to add authentication to ExpressJS with PassportJS and MongoDB. <br>
The reason why i used PassportJS for this project is because it adds just some few lines of more additional code, but let's you add later on a lot more strategies. However, the part of the code that drives the authentication is pretty much the same as without the use of PassportJS. 

For this repo, i used the passport-local strategy. You can add additional strategies. Adding strategies, follows the same principle as shown in this repo. You can find all the avaible strategies here: http://www.passportjs.org/packages/
